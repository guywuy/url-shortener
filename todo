Implement functionality!!
  - Get / route - Render home page with input
  - Post / route,  add full URL to database with corresponding short url key, return short url to user
  - For other routes, check key of URL route in db, if it exists, redirect to originalURL, else error

Use mongodb interface to add submission to collection, along with shortened key

  To implement later - can ask user if they want a specific string to be short URL - if it doesn't already exist in database, use it.
