Implement functionality!!
  - Get / route - Render home page with input
  - Post / route,  add full URL to database with corresponding short url key, return short url to user
  - For other routes, check key of URL route in db, if it exists, redirect to originalURL, else error

Does DB stuff need to go in index.js or in the routes where it will be used? Do I open and close a connection each time request is made or open for duration of lifecycle of app? Probably first.


  To implement later - can ask user if they want a specific string to be short URL - if it doesn't already exist in database, use it.
