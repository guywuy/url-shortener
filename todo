Implement functionality!!
  - Get / route - Render home page with input
  - Post / route,  add full URL to database with corresponding short url key, return short url to user
  - For other routes, check key of URL route in db, if it exists, redirect to originalURL, else error

Make shortURL value unique so there can't be more than one for an originalURL.

Add validation. Make sure (as user types) that url starts with http:// or www.

  To implement later - can ask user if they want a specific string to be short URL - if it doesn't already exist in database, use it.
