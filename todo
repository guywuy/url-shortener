Functionality:
  - Get / route - Render home page with input form
  - Post / route,  add full URL to database with corresponding short url key, return short url to user
  - For other routes, check key of URL route in db, if it exists, redirect to originalURL, else error

Add javascript to select the returned url if it is clicked on.

  To implement later - can ask user if they want a specific string to be short URL - if it doesn't already exist in database, use it.
  Use hash function rather than random number to avoid collisions.
